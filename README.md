# Azure Messaging Sandbox
This repository is a sandbox for the following Azure messaging services : Service Bus, Queue Storage, Event Hubs, Event Grid

* InstallAzureCLI.ps1 : if Azure CLI isn't installed on your local host yet, run this powershell command.

## Queue Storage Sandbox
This sandbox contains 2 projects : a sender and a receiver.
To use it, you need to create a **Storage Account** in a **Resource Group**. You can use the **Build/CreateResources.ps1** file (change the variable according to your needs).

You can then update the 2 files **Program.cs** with the connection string associated with your storage account.
